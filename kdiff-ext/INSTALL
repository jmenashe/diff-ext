Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install prefix>' to configure 
     the package for your system.  

     For system wide installation use $KDEDIR as <install prefix>. You
     may need root priveleges to do so.
     To install kdiff-ext just for yourself use $KDEHOME as 
     <install prefix>. 

     Running `cmake' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.
